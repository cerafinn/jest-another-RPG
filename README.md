## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install` or `npm i`

<br />

## Usage

This is a Node application that leverages inquirer in order to create a role-playing game that can be run locally using the terminal. The user is first prompted to enter a name and then the user enters into a fight against enemies within the RPG. The user has the choice of attacking or using a potion from their inventory. The potions in the inventory are generated randomly.
